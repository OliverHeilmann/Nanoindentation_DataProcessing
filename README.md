# Nanoindentation_DataProcessing
Nanotest Vantage (nanoindentater machine) output depth/loading data is processed by this script. The average of all results contained in the .xlsx file is calculated and a final depth/loading graph is produced. The user must identify and exclude any erroneous results by adding column details in line 44 of SESG6034_Q1.m file.

# Additional Script
An additional script is contained in this repo (SESG6007_CW1.m). Here, the maximum allowable shear forces applied to a bearing are calculated based on input parameters such as hardness, youngs modulus etc.
